# Movie-Watchlist
this project enables users to search for any movie title with a particular search 
query pattern e,g "IRON MAN"  or "SPIDER-MAN" to get a list correct resulting movies, with some information about each movie item. 
this project makes use of the OMDB (Open Movie Data Base) API and user can click on the add watchlist icon to add that particular movie item to another database 
"localStorage" and when you click on the next page called  "MY WATCHLIST" you will be able to access your saved movies
